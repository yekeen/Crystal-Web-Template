# Crystal-Web-Template
Responsive Web Template, Free web template, HTML3, HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, JQUERY, JS

As the name suggests, this CSS/Jquery-based web-template is semi-transparent in UI look and feel.
A practical implementation of this template can be viewed on one of my websites, www.mindqube.in.

Once you download this template and fire up the index.html file on a www browser, things are pretty much self-explanatory.

To give you a rough idea of how you can implement this template in real-life, I have actually included the entire 
www.mindqube.in source into it.

I have used many codes from here and there. And such codes are atrributed to it's creator(s) as and when applicable. 
I have however licensed my own additions and approaches to it as per GPL.

Have fun exploring. And I hope you can create something much better in the process.

Love
Yakeen
